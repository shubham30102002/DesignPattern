Below are the MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS on the Strategy Design Pattern, with crisp, interviewer-approved answers.
These are exactly the questions asked in Java / Spring / System Design rounds.

⭐ Strategy Design Pattern – Interview Questions & Answers
1️⃣ What is the Strategy Design Pattern?

Answer:

Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime without modifying the client.

2️⃣ When should you use the Strategy Pattern?

Answer:

When there are multiple ways to perform an operation

When behavior must change at runtime

When you want to avoid large if-else or switch statements

When adding new behavior should not modify existing code

3️⃣ What problem does Strategy Pattern solve?

Answer:

It removes conditional logic by delegating behavior to separate strategy classes.

4️⃣ What are the main components of Strategy Pattern?

Answer:

Strategy (interface)

Concrete Strategy (implementation)

Context (uses strategy)

5️⃣ Strategy vs State Pattern (VERY COMMON ❗)

Answer:

Strategy	State
Behavior chosen by client	Behavior changes internally
Focus on algorithms	Focus on state
Client aware of strategy	Client unaware of state

One-liner:

Strategy decides how to do something, State decides what state it is in.

6️⃣ How does Strategy follow SOLID principles?

Answer:

OCP: New strategies added without modifying existing code

SRP: Each strategy has one responsibility

DIP: Context depends on abstraction, not concrete class

7️⃣ How is Strategy better than inheritance?

Answer:

Strategy uses composition, allowing runtime behavior changes, whereas inheritance fixes behavior at compile time.

8️⃣ What are the disadvantages of Strategy Pattern?

Answer:

Increases number of classes

Client must know which strategy to use

Slightly more complex design

9️⃣ How is Strategy Pattern implemented in Spring Boot?

Answer:

Using interfaces + multiple implementations

Spring injects correct strategy using:

@Qualifier

@Primary

Factory pattern

🔟 Real-world example of Strategy Pattern?

Answer:

Payment methods (UPI, Card, Net Banking)

Sorting algorithms

Compression (ZIP, RAR)

Authentication providers in Spring Security

1️⃣1️⃣ How does Strategy differ from Factory Pattern?

Answer:

Strategy	Factory
Changes behavior	Creates object
Runtime behavior selection	Object creation logic
Focus on algorithms	Focus on instantiation
1️⃣2️⃣ Can Strategy Pattern violate LSP?

Answer:

No, if strategies adhere to the same interface contract. Violation occurs only if implementations change expected behavior.

1️⃣3️⃣ Can Strategy Pattern be combined with other patterns?

Answer:
✔ Yes
Common combinations:

Strategy + Factory

Strategy + Singleton

Strategy + Template Method

1️⃣4️⃣ Why is Strategy preferred over switch-case?

Answer:

Because switch-case violates Open–Closed Principle and becomes difficult to maintain as logic grows.

1️⃣5️⃣ How do you choose a strategy at runtime?

Answer:

User input

Configuration

Database value

Dependency Injection (Spring)
